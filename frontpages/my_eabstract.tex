The rapid growth of IoT devices in past few years brings convenience in human life. The huge amount of installed IOT devices makes the device manufacturer (vendor) difficult to maintain the IoT devices. One way to maintain the IoT device is through the firmware update. Vendor can add new functionality, enhance the security and re-configure the IoT device through a firmware update. However, the firmware update process is not without risk. There are several well-known attacks those targets the firmware update process. In this thesis, we propose a robust and lightweight framework that ensure the firmware update security using skipchain technology. Utilizing the skipchain's forward link, the proposed protocol can do peer-to-peer firmware update verification efficiently. A prototype based on the proposed framework is constructed and evaluated. Moreover, our proposed framework is also proven to be secure and could withstand some well-known attacks.
