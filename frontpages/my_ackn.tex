First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Professor Lo Nai-Wei,
whose encouragement, thoughtful guidance, brilliant ideas and wholehearted supports
enabled me to develop an understanding of this research subject.
His every advice has been very valuable to my own professional growth and will not be forgotten.
I would also like to extend my gratitude to 
all committee members in my doctoral defense for their valuable comments.

It is a pleasure to thank the members of Integrated Digital Service Laboratory (賴孟泫, Power Li, Eric Tan) and all my friends for their supports and inspirations. Special thanks to Alexander Yohan, because of his passionate guidance, advice, and contributions in everything since my first day in Integrated Digital Service Laboratory.

Finally, I am heartily thankful to my family
for their unconditional love, continuous supports and cheers.
